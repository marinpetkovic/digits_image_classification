# digits_image_classification

We test several models on the zipcode dataset available here: https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/
The dataset contains 7291 train images, and 2007 test images of handwritten digits 0-9.
The images are in the format 16x16 greyscale normalized float numbers.

Table of contents:

1. Data Loading
2. K Nearest Neighbor
3. Linear Regression
4. Neural Network (MLPClassifier)
5. Convolutional Neural Network

We used Jupyter notebook in google.colab.
